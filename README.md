# Digital Image Processing Tasks

This repository contains concise Python scripts for fundamental digital image processing tasks, organized by chapter and topic. Each script demonstrates a key concept with immediate visualization using OpenCV and matplotlib.

## Structure

- Each task is in a separate file, named by its topic (e.g., `1_load_and_display_images.py`).
- All scripts use `image.jpg` as the input image.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- matplotlib
- numpy

Install dependencies:

```sh
pip install opencv-python matplotlib numpy
```

## Usage

Run any script from the command line:

```sh
python 1_load_and_display_images.py
```

Replace the filename with the desired task.

## Tasks Covered

1. Load and Display Images
2. Negative of an Image
3. Image Subsampling
4. Gray-Level Quantization
5. Bit-Plane Slicing
6. Pixel Neighborhood Analysis
7. Histogram and Histogram Equalization
8. Contrast Stretching
9. Smoothing with Spatial Filters
10. Sharpening with Laplacian Filter
11. Fourier Transform and Spectrum Visualization
12. Low-Pass Filtering in Frequency Domain
13. High-Pass Filtering in Frequency Domain
14. Notch Filtering for Periodic Noise Removal
