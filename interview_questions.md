# Digital Image Processing Interview Questions

This document contains common interview questions based on the fundamental image processing tasks covered in this repository. These questions span basic concepts, practical coding, and theoretical understanding.

## 1. Image Types and Display

- What is the difference between a grayscale and a color image?
- How many channels does a grayscale image have? What about a color image?
- How do you load and display images using OpenCV and matplotlib?

## 2. Negative of an Image

- How do you generate the negative of a grayscale image?
- What effect does a negative image have on visual perception?
- Why is 255 used in the formula for image negation?

## 3. Image Subsampling

- What is image subsampling and why is it used?
- How does subsampling affect image resolution and details?
- How can you downsample an image by a factor of N in Python?

## 4. Gray-Level Quantization

- What is gray-level quantization?
- How does reducing the number of gray levels affect image quality?
- How do you implement quantization in code?

## 5. Bit-Plane Slicing

- What is bit-plane slicing in image processing?
- Which bit-planes contain most of the image information?
- How do you extract and visualize bit-planes in Python?

## 6. Pixel Neighborhood Analysis

- What are 4-neighbors and 8-neighbors of a pixel?
- Why are pixel neighborhoods important in filtering and edge detection?
- How do you find the neighbors of a pixel in code?

## 7. Histogram and Histogram Equalization

- What is a histogram in the context of images?
- How does histogram equalization improve image contrast?
- How do you plot and equalize a histogram using OpenCV?

## 8. Contrast Stretching

- What is contrast stretching?
- How does it affect pixel intensities and image appearance?
- How do you perform linear contrast stretching in Python?

## 9. Smoothing with Spatial Filters

- What is the purpose of smoothing (blurring) an image?
- How does kernel size affect the amount of blurring?
- How do you apply an averaging filter in OpenCV?

## 10. Sharpening with Laplacian Filter

- What is the Laplacian filter and how does it work?
- How does sharpening affect image features?
- How do you apply a Laplacian filter in code?

## 11. Fourier Transform and Spectrum Visualization

- What is the 2D Fourier Transform of an image?
- What do low and high-frequency components represent?
- How do you visualize the magnitude spectrum in Python?

## 12. Frequency Domain Filtering

- What is the difference between low-pass and high-pass filtering?
- How do these filters affect image appearance?
- How do you design and apply ideal filters in the frequency domain?

## 13. Notch Filtering for Periodic Noise Removal

- What is periodic noise in images?
- How does a notch filter work to remove specific frequencies?
- How do you add synthetic noise and apply a notch filter in code?
